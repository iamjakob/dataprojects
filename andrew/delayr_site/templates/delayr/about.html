<h2>About Delayr</h2>
<p>Delayr uses advanced machine learning techniques to predict domestic U.S. flight delays based on complex historical patterns. Parsing 10 years of raw on-time arrival data (&gt;75 million flights!) from the <a href="http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/">Bureau of Transportation Statistics</a> Delayr first builds a model containing the impacts on delays from a variety of sources (e.g. origin airport, destination airport, and carrier, just to name a few). Then whenever you give Delayr an itinerary (even for a brand-new route!) it runs your flight through its model to compute the likelihood that your plane will be on-time, delayed, or cancelled. </p>
<p>Beyond the probability that your flight will be delayed (and by how long), for a given itinerary Delayr will also predict how delay times change based on the time of day and day of week . Additionally, if Delayr detects that flights similar to the searched itinerary exist, it will predict their delay times as well and return the flights with the best on-time prediction. These features allow you to make intelligent, data-driven choices when booking air travel.</p>
